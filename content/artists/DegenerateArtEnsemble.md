The Degenerate Art Ensemble (formerly The Young Composer's Collective) is a big-band-garage-orchestra / movement-theater company - dedicated to the creation of new cutting edge works combining music and other media. The band's "eloquently executed high-energy repertoire" (SF Weekly), combined with the "breathtaking imagery" (Seattle PI) of the movement theater ensemble, DAE has created a unique language of expression - raw and passionate - which has earned the ensemble much critical acclaim in recent years.

Formed in 1993, Seattle's Degenerate Art Ensemble features: Erick Cohn - percussion; Brad Hartman - bass; Joshua Kohl - composer/coductor; Steve Lohrentz - trumpet/composer; Ian-Lee Lucero - electric media; Ben McAllister - electric guitar; Haruko Nishimura - choreographer/vocals; Kendal Seager - violin; Greg Sinibaldi - sax/bass clarinet; Josh Stewart - trumpet/composer; Robert Walker - percussion
