*We are extremely sad to report the death of Michael MacDonald on April 11th, 2000 in Boston. He was an amazing musician and a good friend. He will be missed.*

Boston's Jupiter 88 consists of piano, cello, soprano sax, voice, percussion, tape loops, drum programming and electronics.

It draws inspiration from trip-hop/illbient beats; modern composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich and John Cage; magnetic tape pioneers of the 50's and 60's especially Luciano Berio and Ilhan Mimaroglu; jazz musicians like Steve Lacy; and contemporary artists from DJ Shadow and Portishead to the Rachel's.

Michael MacDonald is the founding member and principal songwriter. He perviously played in the Boston Band "Edh."

Darla Villani is the vocalist and co-creator of the arrangements and musical ideas. She was also a composer and vocalist with the electro/acoustic ensemble, "JumpCut Orchestra."
