New York City's M'Lumbo came to our attention a few short years ago when they sent a tape to the label. I had it playing in my car on the highway. Without realizing it, I passed my intended exit and the next one too. I was totally captured by their spell. I knew that we had to have them on the label. M'Lumbo as an entity has since 1984. They first became known as a septet playing jazz-influenced covers of television theme songs. Over time, they slimmed down to a duo and now they exist as a trio musically and a septet again when the entire M'Lumbo crew is performing. That tape that we originally heard was of a sort of a world-ambient-jazz, but in a really twisted sort of way. The group is now experimenting with a more electronic sort of sound, yet again in a twisted way. These Knitting Factory regulars will expand your mind. The members of M'lumbo and Kobalt 6 are: Ron Boggs, Rob Ray, Kurt Johannes Leege, Matt Bass, Ryan Holsopple, Josh Ferrazano and Nellie Phillips.
