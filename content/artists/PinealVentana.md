As unpredictable as the path of a thunderstorm over the Mountains of Madness, the music of Pineal Ventana, roars out of that hostile alternate dimension which H.P. Lovercraft described as "the spaces between." - Creative Loafing

Atlanta's Pineal Ventana are almost the Unit Circle uber-band. Formed in 1993, they embody the ideals of experimentation, exploration, and genre-defying, that we like in all of our releases. That they can do this while maintaining a good tour schedule and amazing stage performances is just icing...

The members are: Clara Clamp - vocals; Mitchell F. - percussion, vocals, keys; Jason LaFarge - guitar, bass, percussion; Lindell Todd - guitar, bass, percussion; Brian Ginn - keys, guitar
