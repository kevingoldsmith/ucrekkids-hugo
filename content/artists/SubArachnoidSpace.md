Founded in San Francisco in 1996, SubArachnoid Space is a four-piece psychedelic improvisational group. Their music can be difficult, dense and intense as well as dreamy, but it's always hallucinatory, going for a mental place where there are no rules. Their definition of psychedelic isn't coming from some mainstream "hippie" place. Instead, it's music that comes from deep inside and has the ability to pull the listener into some other place in an intense way.
