UnFolkUs featured Eveline Muller-Graf on sharp metal objects (she also played on the first <a href="../Intonarumori/">Intonarumori<a> album), <a href="../BillHorist/">Bill Horist</a> on Guitar, Paul Hoskin on Contrabass Clarinet, and Rob Bageant on Chapman Stick.

UnFolkUs was launched in the summer of 1996 as an untamed, noise-based improv ensemble, almost as happy to be run out of downtown art galleries as they were to incite raucous approval. Not content to remain in place, the band have since explored a vast range of improvised soundscapes and lineups, maturing into an ensemble with a tremendous depth of communication and intesely broad palette of expression. The band have discovered and explored depths of quietude as deep as their walls of noise were tall (which is not to say that they don't retain a penchant for well-placed sonic assaults).

Those explorations took UnFolkUs to venues throughout the Northwest, from Portland to Bellingham, to Olympia and Seattle. Highlights of the journey include spots at the Seattle Improvised Music Festival, Olympia's Experimental Music Festival, and several live radio shows on Olympia's KAOS and Seattle station KCMU's Sonarchy radio program.
