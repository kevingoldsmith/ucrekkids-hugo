Vassily formed in Seattle in the fall of 1994 and was playing regular live shows by the spring of 1995. They described their sound as "Visigoth Rock." It was a strange mixture of dark rock and post-grunge. Two labels that they hated. The band disbanded late in 1995.

The band featured Ray Hodder on Vocals, Dave Miller on Guitar, Steve Phun on Drums, The Guitarist formerly known as David on Guitar and Kevin wHATEver on bass.
