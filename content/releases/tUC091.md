Reich-like was the first Answers to April track recorded so long ago, I don't even remember when it was. I knew I had something I liked, but it was so different than everything else I was doing, I didn't know what I wanted to do with it. 

After moving from Seattle to Sweden in 2013, I found myself wanting to move in a different direction than my Intonarumori work. I have been doing that project for over 25 years. I had always appreciated the post-classical or orchestral-pop projects and composers like Max Richter, Ã“lafur Arnalds, Arca, Balmorhea, Ben Lukas Boysen, and Winged Victory for the Sullen. As I started working on new material it started leaning in that direction. A direction I hope to keep exploring.

Consider this an introduction, a calling card. I hope that you like it, and I hope to bring you more soon.
