In 1999, I recorded a 60+ minute improvisation and then overdubbed 3 more parts on top of it. I did a quick mix of it but never released it. 22 years later, I rediscovered the tape.

I approached it like a tape sent through the mail from a collaborator and added to it coming from the perspective of who I am as a musician now. It was a gratifying and enjoyable experience and I'm quite proud of the result. Looking forward to sharing it with you soon.

This album also commemorates the 30th anniversary of my first release in 1991.
