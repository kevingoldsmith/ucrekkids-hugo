This song was created trying to distract myself from doomscrolling about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a region my family emigrated to the US from. The languid guitar part made me think of water flowing, but the drums sound almost like marching boots. As I mixed it, the attacks on Melitopol had begun. I named this song after the Molochna river that the city sits on. All proceeds from this song will go to Ukranian humanitarian and medical relief.

This single was released on April 5, 2022
