One day I sat down at the piano and this song just flowed out of me. I tried
working it into something larger, but it defied those attempts. I got rid of
the unnecessary adornments and am much happier with it. For this EP, I present
the song in three versions at different levels of complexity, but all based on
the original piano track. *- Kevin Goldsmith*

This song will be released on January 31st, 2023.
