      <description>Answers to April is the new project from Kevin Goldsmith, of Intonarumori, and Vassily. More melodic than the former and quieter with more electronic elements than the latter.</description>

      <description>Vassily formed in Seattle in the fall of 1994 and was playing regular live shows by the spring of 1995. They described their sound as &amp;ldquo;Visigoth Rock.&amp;rdquo; It was a strange mixture of dark rock and post-grunge. Two labels that they hated. The band disbanded late in 1995.
The band featured Ray Hodder on Vocals, Dave Miller on Guitar, Steve Phun on Drums, The Guitarist formerly known as David on Guitar and Kevin wHATEver on bass.</description>

      <description>UnFolkUs featured Eveline Muller-Graf on sharp metal objects (she also played on the first Intonarumori album), Bill Horist on Guitar, Paul Hoskin on Contrabass Clarinet, and Rob Bageant on Chapman Stick.
UnFolkUs was launched in the summer of 1996 as an untamed, noise-based improv ensemble, almost as happy to be run out of downtown art galleries as they were to incite raucous approval. Not content to remain in place, the band have since explored a vast range of improvised soundscapes and lineups, maturing into an ensemble with a tremendous depth of communication and intesely broad palette of expression.</description>

      <description>Formed in 1985, in Pittsburgh, The Garden was a long-lived, unique-sounding gothic project. The Garden featured Christine Sacramento on guitars, keyboards and drum programing; Anthony Lacava on bass; Stephen Marlette on vocals; and Shelly O&amp;rsquo;Keefe on percussion and keyboards.</description>

      <description>Founded in San Francisco in 1996, SubArachnoid Space is a four-piece psychedelic improvisational group. Their music can be difficult, dense and intense as well as dreamy, but it&amp;rsquo;s always hallucinatory, going for a mental place where there are no rules. Their definition of psychedelic isn&amp;rsquo;t coming from some mainstream &amp;ldquo;hippie&amp;rdquo; place. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s music that comes from deep inside and has the ability to pull the listener into some other place in an intense way.</description>

      <description>As unpredictable as the path of a thunderstorm over the Mountains of Madness, the music of Pineal Ventana, roars out of that hostile alternate dimension which H.P. Lovercraft described as &amp;ldquo;the spaces between.&amp;rdquo; - Creative Loafing
Atlanta&amp;rsquo;s Pineal Ventana are almost the Unit Circle uber-band. Formed in 1993, they embody the ideals of experimentation, exploration, and genre-defying, that we like in all of our releases. That they can do this while maintaining a good tour schedule and amazing stage performances is just icing&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>New York City&amp;rsquo;s M&amp;rsquo;Lumbo came to our attention a few short years ago when they sent a tape to the label. I had it playing in my car on the highway. Without realizing it, I passed my intended exit and the next one too. I was totally captured by their spell. I knew that we had to have them on the label. M&amp;rsquo;Lumbo as an entity has since 1984. They first became known as a septet playing jazz-influenced covers of television theme songs.</description>

      <description>We are extremely sad to report the death of Michael MacDonald on April 11th, 2000 in Boston. He was an amazing musician and a good friend. He will be missed.
Boston&amp;rsquo;s Jupiter 88 consists of piano, cello, soprano sax, voice, percussion, tape loops, drum programming and electronics.
It draws inspiration from trip-hop/illbient beats; modern composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich and John Cage; magnetic tape pioneers of the 50&amp;rsquo;s and 60&amp;rsquo;s especially Luciano Berio and Ilhan Mimaroglu; jazz musicians like Steve Lacy; and contemporary artists from DJ Shadow and Portishead to the Rachel&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Amy Denio first made a name for herself as a &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; composer of contemporary classical music. Then, for almost a decade, she was a member of the Seattle-based Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet, an all-female ensemble named after a woman who posed as a man to be able to work in the male-dominated jazz world of the 1930&amp;rsquo;s and &amp;lsquo;40&amp;rsquo;s. But just as the quartet was gaining a national reputation, Denio quit to pursue a solo career playing her own odd style of folk-rock, in which she plays saxophone, accordion, bass, and a bunch of other instruments.</description>

      <description>Kevin Goldsmith has been composing under the name &amp;ldquo;Intonarumori&amp;rdquo; since he studied experimental and electronic composition with composer Reza Vali at Carnegie Mellon University in 1990-2. In addition to composing, Kevin performs on a variety of instruments: Cello, 5 String Electric Cello, Bass Guitar, D-Tar (prepared guitar), Synthesizer and Electronics.
The word &amp;ldquo;Intonarumori&amp;rdquo; is Italian and it means &amp;ldquo;noise intoners.&amp;rdquo; The word comes from the Italian Futurist art movement. The Intonarumori were machines built to mimic the industrial sounds of the age.</description>
