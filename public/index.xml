      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vassily formed in Seattle in the fall of 1994 and was playing regular live shows by the spring of 1995. They described their sound as &amp;ldquo;Visigoth Rock.&amp;rdquo; It was a strange mixture of dark rock and post-grunge. Two labels that they hated. The band disbanded late in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band featured Ray Hodder on Vocals, Dave Miller on Guitar, Steve Phun on Drums, The Guitarist formerly known as David on Guitar and Kevin wHATEver on bass.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UnFolkUs</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/artists/UnFolkUs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;UnFolkUs featured Eveline Muller-Graf on sharp metal objects (she also played on the first &lt;a href=&#34;../Intonarumori/&#34;&gt;Intonarumori&lt;a&gt; album), &lt;a href=&#34;../BillHorist/&#34;&gt;Bill Horist&lt;/a&gt; on Guitar, Paul Hoskin on Contrabass Clarinet, and Rob Bageant on Chapman Stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UnFolkUs was launched in the summer of 1996 as an untamed, noise-based improv ensemble, almost as happy to be run out of downtown art galleries as they were to incite raucous approval. Not content to remain in place, the band have since explored a vast range of improvised soundscapes and lineups, maturing into an ensemble with a tremendous depth of communication and intesely broad palette of expression. The band have discovered and explored depths of quietude as deep as their walls of noise were tall (which is not to say that they don&amp;rsquo;t retain a penchant for well-placed sonic assaults).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those explorations took UnFolkUs to venues throughout the Northwest, from Portland to Bellingham, to Olympia and Seattle. Highlights of the journey include spots at the Seattle Improvised Music Festival, Olympia&amp;rsquo;s Experimental Music Festival, and several live radio shows on Olympia&amp;rsquo;s KAOS and Seattle station KCMU&amp;rsquo;s Sonarchy radio program.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Formed in 1985, in Pittsburgh, The Garden was a long-lived, unique-sounding gothic project. The Garden featured Christine Sacramento on guitars, keyboards and drum programing; Anthony Lacava on bass; Stephen Marlette on vocals; and Shelly O&amp;rsquo;Keefe on percussion and keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Founded in San Francisco in 1996, SubArachnoid Space is a four-piece psychedelic improvisational group. Their music can be difficult, dense and intense as well as dreamy, but it&amp;rsquo;s always hallucinatory, going for a mental place where there are no rules. Their definition of psychedelic isn&amp;rsquo;t coming from some mainstream &amp;ldquo;hippie&amp;rdquo; place. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s music that comes from deep inside and has the ability to pull the listener into some other place in an intense way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As unpredictable as the path of a thunderstorm over the Mountains of Madness, the music of Pineal Ventana, roars out of that hostile alternate dimension which H.P. Lovercraft described as &amp;ldquo;the spaces between.&amp;rdquo; - Creative Loafing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlanta&amp;rsquo;s Pineal Ventana are almost the Unit Circle uber-band. Formed in 1993, they embody the ideals of experimentation, exploration, and genre-defying, that we like in all of our releases. That they can do this while maintaining a good tour schedule and amazing stage performances is just icing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The members are: Clara Clamp - vocals; Mitchell F. - percussion, vocals, keys; Jason LaFarge - guitar, bass, percussion; Lindell Todd - guitar, bass, percussion; Brian Ginn - keys, guitar&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New York City&amp;rsquo;s M&amp;rsquo;Lumbo came to our attention a few short years ago when they sent a tape to the label. I had it playing in my car on the highway. Without realizing it, I passed my intended exit and the next one too. I was totally captured by their spell. I knew that we had to have them on the label. M&amp;rsquo;Lumbo as an entity has since 1984. They first became known as a septet playing jazz-influenced covers of television theme songs. Over time, they slimmed down to a duo and now they exist as a trio musically and a septet again when the entire M&amp;rsquo;Lumbo crew is performing. That tape that we originally heard was of a sort of a world-ambient-jazz, but in a really twisted sort of way. The group is now experimenting with a more electronic sort of sound, yet again in a twisted way. These Knitting Factory regulars will expand your mind. The members of M&amp;rsquo;lumbo and Kobalt 6 are: Ron Boggs, Rob Ray, Kurt Johannes Leege, Matt Bass, Ryan Holsopple, Josh Ferrazano and Nellie Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are extremely sad to report the death of Michael MacDonald on April 11th, 2000 in Boston. He was an amazing musician and a good friend. He will be missed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boston&amp;rsquo;s Jupiter 88 consists of piano, cello, soprano sax, voice, percussion, tape loops, drum programming and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It draws inspiration from trip-hop/illbient beats; modern composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich and John Cage; magnetic tape pioneers of the 50&amp;rsquo;s and 60&amp;rsquo;s especially Luciano Berio and Ilhan Mimaroglu; jazz musicians like Steve Lacy; and contemporary artists from DJ Shadow and Portishead to the Rachel&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael MacDonald is the founding member and principal songwriter. He perviously played in the Boston Band &amp;ldquo;Edh.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darla Villani is the vocalist and co-creator of the arrangements and musical ideas. She was also a composer and vocalist with the electro/acoustic ensemble, &amp;ldquo;JumpCut Orchestra.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amy Denio</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/artists/AmyDenio/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/artists/AmyDenio/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amy Denio first made a name for herself as a &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; composer of contemporary classical music. Then, for almost a decade, she was a member of the Seattle-based Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet, an all-female ensemble named after a woman who posed as a man to be able to work in the male-dominated jazz world of the 1930&amp;rsquo;s and &amp;lsquo;40&amp;rsquo;s. But just as the quartet was gaining a national reputation, Denio quit to pursue a solo career playing her own odd style of folk-rock, in which she plays saxophone, accordion, bass, and a bunch of other instruments. - From the NPR commentary aired January 11th, 1999&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t just perform solo, Amy is and has been a member of such groups as The Tone Dogs, The Pale Nudes, and FoMoFlo. Her most recent major work is for the Austrian chamber ensemble, Die Knödel. It&amp;rsquo;s an oratorio inspired by Italo Calvino&amp;rsquo;s book Invisible Cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Denio has established herself at the crossroads of jazz, experimentation, white funk, and rock. Not many musicians can even envision the kind of musical gamut Denio so offhandedly enjoys exploring, and even few do it with such gusto, humor, and wit.&amp;rdquo; - (Rock&amp;rsquo;s 10 Smartest, strongest women) Elizabeth Vincentelli, Request Magazine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Once your have heard her perform, adoration could turn to something stronger. On stage (she) doesn&amp;rsquo;t sing, she emotes. She has a remarkable stillness, an otherworldliness from which emanates melodies quite unlike what you may have heard before.&amp;rdquo; - Vinod Advani, Sunday Times of India (Bombay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo; Denio is the Peppermint Patty we all knew as kids: smart, funny, able to make music from paper clips, rubber bands, and blades of grass.&amp;rdquo; - Andew Jones, Option Magazine&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intonarumori</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/artists/Intonarumori/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2014 11:32:28 CET</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/artists/Intonarumori/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kevin Goldsmith has been composing under the name &amp;ldquo;Intonarumori&amp;rdquo; since he studied experimental and electronic composition with composer Reza Vali at Carnegie Mellon University in 1990-2. In addition to composing, Kevin performs on a variety of instruments: Cello, 5 String Electric Cello, Bass Guitar, D-Tar (prepared guitar), Synthesizer and Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;Intonarumori&amp;rdquo; is Italian and it means &amp;ldquo;noise intoners.&amp;rdquo; The word comes from the Italian Futurist art movement. The Intonarumori were machines built to mimic the industrial sounds of the age. The Futurist composers created symphonies for the machines. Their concerts often resulted in fist-fights with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intonarumori, the project, is very much influenced by the ideas of the Futurists as well as the more modern ideas of the serialists, the minimalists, the musique concrete-ists and modern experimental and industrial composers. Intonarumori performs rarely, but completed a 16 city us tour in the summer of 1998 which included performances with Cul De Sac, Mason Jones, and Ken Vandermark. Kevin&amp;rsquo;s early compositions incorporated many minimalist techniques of repition, blending them with Music Concrete ideas of found sounds and using some of John Cage&amp;rsquo;s chance operation concepts. These compositions were extremely reliant on studio technology to create. In recent years, Intonarumori compositions have become more open and less structured. These compositions create a situation for the performer for which he or she can use any method that they find suitable to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Deeply atmospheric collage pieces bear the influence of John Cage and Phillip Glass. Intonarumori&amp;rsquo;s pastiches of electronic noise and classical instruments such as cello and piano create velvety, hallucinatory soundscapes sometimes broken by the inclusion of harsh industrial dissonance. These songs are a disquieting mix of placid pastoralism and icy futurism.&amp;rdquo; - Listen.com&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intonarumori - L-ST</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC090/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2013 00:00:00 &#43;0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC090/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the 2002 release of Material, Intonarumori&amp;rsquo;s Kevin Goldsmith began looking towards new approaches to composition and ways of producing sound. Having spent more than a decade producing electro-acoustic sounds by combining cello, bass and other instruments with electronic processing and synthesized ambiences into a sometimes sonic overloading wash of sound, what Goldsmith called maximal-minimalism; he wanted to move into more subtler areas. Over the next few years of performing and recording as Intonarumori as well as with transPacifc, he produced several tracks for a drastically different new album from his previous work. After going through the tracks several times, he decided to put the album to the side so that he could come at it with fresh ears. The original plan of waiting a few months became a few years. Finally, in 2013 after a re-location to Europe, Goldsmith returned to those tracks again. With a new critical ear, he pruned mercilessly, adding only those tracks which he felt had stood the test of time. The result is L-ST, a new approach for Intonarumori. A lost album, but something that still sounds vital and contemporary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jupiter 88 - Red Go</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michael MacDonald, founder and leading force behind Jupiter 88 died unexpectedly in April of 2000. He had already completed recordings for the band&amp;rsquo;s second CD, RedGo. The material for this CD was recorded in 2 different studios - in 2 different incarnations of the band. The original band was predominantly made up of Michael and vocalist Darla Villani. They produced the band&amp;rsquo;s first CD, Jupiter 88, which was released by Unit Circle Rekkids in 1998. The second and final incarnation of the band consisted of MacDonald, vocalist Rosa Pullman, and Jonathan Lemaster. Michael&amp;rsquo;s most brilliant vision was to successfully marry the avant garde music that he loved (e.g. Shoenburg, electronic and tape based music, 20th Century chamber music, and free improv) with the populist beats of rock, country, trip hop and electronica. We at Unit Circle are proud to team up with Sublingual Records to allow Michael&amp;rsquo;s final set of songs to be enjoyed by all.&lt;/p&gt;
