      <title>Intonarumori - L-ST</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC090/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the 2002 release of Material, Intonarumori&amp;rsquo;s Kevin Goldsmith began looking towards new approaches to composition and ways of producing sound. Having spent more than a decade producing electro-acoustic sounds by combining cello, bass and other instruments with electronic processing and synthesized ambiences into a sometimes sonic overloading wash of sound, what Goldsmith called maximal-minimalism; he wanted to move into more subtler areas. Over the next few years of performing and recording as Intonarumori as well as with transPacifc, he produced several tracks for a drastically different new album from his previous work. After going through the tracks several times, he decided to put the album to the side so that he could come at it with fresh ears. The original plan of waiting a few months became a few years. Finally, in 2013 after a re-location to Europe, Goldsmith returned to those tracks again. With a new critical ear, he pruned mercilessly, adding only those tracks which he felt had stood the test of time. The result is L-ST, a new approach for Intonarumori. A lost album, but something that still sounds vital and contemporary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jupiter 88 - Red Go</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michael MacDonald, founder and leading force behind Jupiter 88 died unexpectedly in April of 2000. He had already completed recordings for the band&amp;rsquo;s second CD, RedGo. The material for this CD was recorded in 2 different studios - in 2 different incarnations of the band. The original band was predominantly made up of Michael and vocalist Darla Villani. They produced the band&amp;rsquo;s first CD, Jupiter 88, which was released by Unit Circle Rekkids in 1998. The second and final incarnation of the band consisted of MacDonald, vocalist Rosa Pullman, and Jonathan Lemaster. Michael&amp;rsquo;s most brilliant vision was to successfully marry the avant garde music that he loved (e.g. Shoenburg, electronic and tape based music, 20th Century chamber music, and free improv) with the populist beats of rock, country, trip hop and electronica. We at Unit Circle are proud to team up with Sublingual Records to allow Michael&amp;rsquo;s final set of songs to be enjoyed by all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bethany Curve - You Brought Us Here</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC074/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bethany Curve have been long known for their exactness and attention to detail, especially in the studio. For this album, they created their own studio so they could be free of the constraints of the rented studio clock. The result was this album, three years in the making and their most complex and polished to date. Their sound continues to evolve around their atmospheric, soaring style. This album was released on September 4, 2001&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as The Young Composers Collective, Seattle&amp;rsquo;s Degenerate Art Ensemble continue to amaze with their blending of modern classical music with Asian and experimental influences. From Zorn-style avant-jazz crazyness to Boredoms-esqe noise attacks with a stopover in Stockhausen country, this album is absolutely worth delving into.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After five years of releasing CDs, we realized that people would know about one or two of the bands on the Label, but not the others. To rectify the situation, we asked all of the bands on the label to contribute a track to a new compilation that we could give away super cheap. This is the result, six brand new tracks and one classic from almost all of your favorite Unit Circle groups (the only one we missed was UnFolkUs). &lt;em&gt;This CD is now out of print.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to attend the primeire of Tattoo by the Pat Graney Dance Company in Seattle in the fall of 1999. The piece is a stunning work in all aspects, especially the score by Amy Denio. I&amp;rsquo;d been thinking for a long time that I wanted Unit Circle to start doing a soundtrack series. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in doing traditional soundtracks though. Soundtracks currently dominate the music market and feature films are frequently viewed as a venue for selling soundtrack CDs first. I wanted to feature soundtracks that were truly of their subject and could stand on their own as well. After seeing Tattoo, I knew that it needed to be our first release in the Unit Circle Soundtrack series, and here it is! It was released in September of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pineal Ventana - Axes to Ice</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC067/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC067/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is Pineal Ventana&amp;rsquo;s second release for Unit Circle Rekkids. The first, Malpractice, was a soaring and driving collection of songs that drove from quiet spaces into walls of screaching noise. This album is a greater exploration of the possibilities of sound. The members of Pineal Ventana stray even further from convention without abandoning what makes their music unique. This is a far scarier record. This CD was released on September 5th, 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bill Horist - Songs From the Nerve Wheel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is Bill Horist&amp;rsquo;s second release for Unit Circle Rekkids. His first, Soylent Radio, was an amazing exploration of sonic weirdness translated through wild guitar manipulations. Bill&amp;rsquo;s style grew and his abilities expanded in the three years since Soylent Radio and this record. Bill takes his patented guitar manipulations technique and expands his palette into new soundscapes and more rhythmic and textural possibilities. This CD was released on June 6, 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intonarumori - Intonarumori</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC062/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC062/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is Intonarumori&amp;rsquo;s first full length release. It&amp;rsquo;s about frigging time. The project has been around since 1990. This is an unusual album for Intonarumori because it represents material that was all recorded live in concert recorded straight from Intonarumori&amp;rsquo;s board. Listening to the album it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to believe that the first three pieces were all recorded by one person. There are layers and shifting textures, ambiences and spaces. The second half of the album represents a work created for small chamber ensemble (Cello, Violin, Toy Piano, Found Percussion, and two vocalists) to celebrate Paul Celan. A very different sound and very unexpected from Intonarumori. This CD was released on December 21st, 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>M&#39;lumbo - Spinning Tourists in a City of Ghosts</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC061/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC061/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This album has been a very long time in the making. M&amp;rsquo;lumbo first approached us in 1996 with a tape of an album that they had finished. It was an excellent mix of avant-jazz with world music beats and textures. It captivated us with it&amp;rsquo;s unique sounds. Due to some confusion, that album was eventually released by Staalplaat. It turns out to have been a good thing, because the M&amp;rsquo;lumbo crew put together a whole new album for us that is much much better. They still have elements of world music in their stew, but now it&amp;rsquo;s updated with more electronic sounds and textures. It shows how the band continue to mature and grow and refuse to get stale. This album was released on October 5th, 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amy Denio - Greatest Hits</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC060/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC060/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Amy approached us about putting out a Greatest Hits album, we were ecstatic. Amy has produced an amazing amount of excellent music over her career. It was a hard time figuring out which pieces to use. Luckily for us, MØre Music, in Italy, had produced a limited-edition version of a Greatest Hits album and had picked almost the perfect tracks. We augmented their choices with some of our own, including newer material. The result is as much as we could have ever hoped for. A collection of material from an artist with a long and distinguished career that succeeds in showing where she has been and where she is going.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC058/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the Unit Circle Debut from Atlanta-based &lt;a href=&#34;../../artists/PinealVentana/&#34;&gt;Pineal Ventana&lt;/a&gt;. It was released in April of 1999. We&amp;rsquo;d been talking with Mitch and Clara for years. It took a while to figure out how we wanted to work together, but this is the fruit of that effort: a super kick-ass record. This album was recorded by Martin Bisi whose production and engineering credits include Sonic Youth, Material, and Michael Gira. Martin Bisi also produced their next album &amp;quot;Axes to Ice&amp;quot; which ended up being their final recording.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jupiter 88 - Jupiter 88 EP</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC056/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 1998 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC056/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the debut EP from the Boston-based duo, &lt;a href=&#34;../../artists/Jupiter88/&#34;&gt;Jupiter 88&lt;/a&gt;. and the only album featuring the original pairing of Darla Villani and Michael MacDonald. Before we released this album, We&amp;rsquo;d been corresponding with them for quite some time. Their music was always good, but we never expected it to be as amazing as this CD is. This was a joint release with their label, Subsonic Records.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UnFolkUs - UnFolkUs</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC055/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC055/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&#34;../../artists/UnFolkUs/&#34;&gt;UnFolkUs&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; first and only release. This Seattle improvisors super group featured Paul Hoskin, Bill Horist, Eveline Muller-Graf and Rob Bageant. The band discovered and explored depths of quietude as deep as their walls of noise were tall (which is not to say that they don&amp;rsquo;t retain a penchant for well-placed sonic assaults).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;UnFolkUs pushes its music through a kaleidoscope of effects, extensions, and extremeties and onto a fresh sonic terrain build out of free jazz and post-classical, contemporary concert music.&amp;quot; - The Stranger. This disc is a joint release between Unit Circle Rekkids and the band.&lt;/p&gt;
