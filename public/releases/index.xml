      <title>Intonarumori - L-ST</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC090/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the 2002 release of Material, Intonarumori&amp;rsquo;s Kevin Goldsmith began looking towards new approaches to composition and ways of producing sound. Having spent more than a decade producing electro-acoustic sounds by combining cello, bass and other instruments with electronic processing and synthesized ambiences into a sometimes sonic overloading wash of sound, what Goldsmith called maximal-minimalism; he wanted to move into more subtler areas. Over the next few years of performing and recording as Intonarumori as well as with transPacifc, he produced several tracks for a drastically different new album from his previous work. After going through the tracks several times, he decided to put the album to the side so that he could come at it with fresh ears. The original plan of waiting a few months became a few years. Finally, in 2013 after a re-location to Europe, Goldsmith returned to those tracks again. With a new critical ear, he pruned mercilessly, adding only those tracks which he felt had stood the test of time. The result is L-ST, a new approach for Intonarumori. A lost album, but something that still sounds vital and contemporary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bethany Curve - You Brought Us Here</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC074/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bethany Curve have been long known for their exactness and attention to detail, especially in the studio. For this album, they created their own studio so they could be free of the constraints of the rented studio clock. The result was this album, three years in the making and their most complex and polished to date. Their sound continues to evolve around their atmospheric, soaring style. This album was released on September 4, 2001&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is Bethany Curve&amp;rsquo;s second album for the label. This first Skies A Crossed Sky was amazing. This one is better, in fact, it is the best-selling album on the label and was the first Unit Circle release to break into the CMJ top 200.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bill Horist - Soylent Radio</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first met Bill not long after he arrived in Seattle. He auditioned for a band I was playing in at the time. We were playing straight ahead rock more or less. He came in with this amazingly wild guitar work. All of the place, but not sloppy. He knew exactly what he was doing. He didn&amp;rsquo;t get the gig, mostly because the rest of us doubted that we could keep up with him. I knew that I&amp;rsquo;d met up with a unique talent and kept in touch with him. His first solo release came on the &lt;a href=&#34;../tUC021/&#34; target=&#34;main&#34;&gt;Nocturne Concr&amp;#232;te Compilation&lt;/a&gt; that Unit Circle put out in 1995. He has continued to refine his improv skills by playing with a number of the coolest improv ensembles around the Seattle area, including &lt;a href=&#34;../UnFolkUs&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UnFolkUs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;b&gt;SpringTrapHum&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Fin&lt;/b&gt;. Beyond his amazing solo pieces, this CD features some excellent duets with Seattle Area Improvisers Rich Hinklin, Eveline Muller and Troy Swanson. This is Bill&amp;rsquo;s first full-length album, his second &amp;quot;Songs From the Nerve Wheel&amp;quot; was also released by Unit Circle in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SubArachnoid Space - Ether Or</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/releases/tUC041/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Mason gave me a chance to put out SubArachnoid Space&amp;rsquo;s second CD (their first was on Charnel House), I jumped at the chance. SAS&amp;rsquo; music is sometimes wild, sometimes subtle, but always interesting. Even more interesting when you consider that ALL of it is improvised. I was given a ton of material that the band had recorded, and I selected a set of pieces that I thought fit well withing the Unit Circle&amp;rsquo;s roster. The work presented on this disc is slightly more ponderous and dark, but it still shows their range as a unique ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bethany Curve&amp;rsquo;s first, self-produced, album came in while preparation was underway for Nocturne Concrète. It was frankly amazing. Probably the best demo tape we&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard. They became the first band to officially &amp;ldquo;sign&amp;rdquo; with Unit Circle Rekkids. They followed up this great record with the stellar &amp;ldquo;Gold&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;You Brought Us Here&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nocturne Concrète was our first CD. We gathered together 13 of our favorite bands crossing all the genres that we hoped to represent on the label. This album spans electronic, ambient, experiment, gothic and avant-rock genres.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Released in 1995, this is Intonarumori&amp;rsquo;s first full-length release. It collects many of Intonarumori&amp;rsquo;s early sound collage pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Garden have been playing around Pittsburgh, PA since the mid-eighties. They have done several amazing self-produced cassettes, but had never been released on another label. We wanted to get the word out about them, because they deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
